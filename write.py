"""Write a stream of close approaches to CSV or to JSON.

This module exports two functions: `write_to_csv` and `write_to_json`, each of
which accept an `results` stream of close approaches and a path to which to
write the data.

These functions are invoked by the main module with the output of the `limit`
function and the filename supplied by the user at the command line. The file's
extension determines which of these functions is used.

You'll edit this file in Part 4.
